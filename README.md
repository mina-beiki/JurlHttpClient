# JurlHttpClient
My midterm project in AP(Advanced Programming) course . This is a http client program like insomnia which can send http requests with different formats and display the responses . 


This project was completed in 3 phases .
phase 1 : GUI and graphics design for the whole project
phase 2 : console application like curl that can handle sending requests and displaying the responses with different features .
phase 3 : connecting phase 1 and 2 which results in a program like insomnia which we call it Jurl !
